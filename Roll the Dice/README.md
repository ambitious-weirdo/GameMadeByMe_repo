# Two Player ROLL THE DICE 🎲 CLASSIC game!

---

enter your names, then start playing.

First player can roll the dice as many times as he/she wants (but if a 1 comes, then the score is reset to Zero), so roll some and then save it.

Then the second player does the same.

The first player to reach 50 !, wins 🏆 the game.

Enjoy. 😀
